# BusyBus

BusyBus is a bus locator app showing the arrival and destination times of incoming buses. This is part of the Bloc UX Design program curriculum.

## The Challenge

Due to bus route expansion throughout the local bus system, bus riders want to know the next arrival of their bus and the amount of time they have to get to the bus stop, especially at the Washington and State bus stop with seven bus lines serving it.

## The Solution

Users wanted live notifications and reliable, updated bus schedules. It was built with simple, straightforward visual design in accordance with Material Guidelines.


## The Process

### Understanding The Users

#### Survey

A survey conducted found that 80% of 20 respondents used Google Maps. They liked being able to read bus schedules, plan bus trips in other cities, and send their location in real time. However, they wanted to see live notifications, have reliable bus schedules that shows traffic delays and other events, and better design.

#### Competitive Analysis

A competitive analysis of the public transit apps Citymapper and Moovit shows that a niche competitor would one that has a simpler design with defined choices of arrival/departure times and would have live notifications


#### Paper Prototype and User Results

The developed user stories prioritized Bus arrival and departure times at Washington and State, live alerts for traffic and delays, and reliable, updated bus schedules. I sketched a simple interface that shows the bus line numbers, bus stop, and the amount of time for arrival. The paper prototype showed these essential steps: https://marvelapp.com/33090ba .

All three users found the prototype readable and easy to follow. They were able to click through the tasks easily to find the bus line, see the bus route, and view all bus lines at the bus stop.Two users recommended adding details: city, state, and zip code to first screen. THe third user suggested more space between bus lines.

### Designing the prototype

For the visual design of the app, teal with cobalt accent for the bus line numbers to add brightness and reliance as it's close to green.The back-left button was added instead of the BusyBus logo for users to go back to the first screen. The star, update, and info icons were added to the second screen so users may add any bus lines as their favorite and can refresh for consistent updates.

As the final step of the project, this prototype was created with HTML and CSS. The Header and icons with teal background in HTML. Info icons are correctly aligned vertically according to Material Design guidelines. Since this was my first time coding the project, I took time to have help with mentors and understand how to put it all together.

### Takeaways

This project taught me the basics of UX fundamentals from user research to visual design to HTML/CSS. It made me understand the crux of constant iteration from user feedback while conforming to standard Material guidelines and keeping in line with the user stories. This gave me the foundation for learning UX design much further by reading more about UX and learning more about how to code.
